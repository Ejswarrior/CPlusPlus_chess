A 2 player chess game using C++ and the SMFL library. This is utilizing best practices for Object Orienated Programming. Once a two player local chess game is complete I would like to implement multiplayer and an AI to play against. 

Future features:
1. Ai computer to player against
2. Online multiplayer
3. Track each move made
